# Data-Analysis-with-Python---Independent-Project

## Problem Statement<br />
While applying for university, foreign student populations could greatly benefit from data
and resources to support their wellbeing and success. Such students and families often
lack the necessary information to distinguish between their school options, access
services, and identify affordable housing near the high-quality school and in safe
neighborhoods with access to transit and employment.<br />
Jane is a 20-year-old high school graduate from Nigeria. She has recently completed her
high school education and has decided to pursue a degree in Management Systems and
Information Technology in the United States.<br />
Jane has approached your university recruiting agency and has tasked you to help her
search for the best school for her. She is willing to relocate anywhere in the continental
United States, but she has a few criteria that her excellent schools must satisfy:<br />
● safety (low crime)<br />
● urban -- Jane wants to live the big city life<br />
● start-ups -- the school should be in a metropolitan area that ranks highly in
entrepreneurialism (she plans to find an internship at a startup while she studies).
Jane would like you to help her narrow down her search to a list of schools that she can
investigate more closely before deciding. You need to produce a dataset of schools that
satisfy all of Jane's criteria, ranking them from best to worst according to the same
criteria.<br />

Jane's schools must:<br />
● Be in an urban/metropolitan area.<br />
● Be in a city that ranks 75th percentile or higher on Kauffman's start-up rankings.<br />
● Be below 50th percentile in overall crime.<br />
● Offer a 2-year or 4-year degree in Information Technology/Science.<br />
